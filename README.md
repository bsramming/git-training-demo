# Do you git it? A primer on git.

What better way to learn git then with a git repo containing all the training material?


## Description

Are you on a team that uses git, but not sure what it is exactly? Or are you working on a project and having trouble tracking changes and managing versions? Or is coordinating work across team-members taking a lot of time and effort? Then git might be a good solution for you and your team, and this primer will help you understand some of the basics!

Git has become a very popular name in version control systems and is widely used by big companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Primarily used by software developers for software code management and collaboration, git is starting to be used for other use cases such as documentation, process management, and better collaboration. In this training you will get an overview of git and learn how to use some of its primary commands such as clone, branch, pull, commit, push and log.


## What We Wont Cover...

This course is intended to be an introduction to the basics of git. Therefore, the following topics won't be covered:
- Git "Providers" such as GitHub, GitLab.
- Repo creation. Typically this is handled using one of the "Providers" mentioned above. And each one has their own approach.
- Branching models (Could be a great future topic!)
- Git desktop tools and IDE integration (in great detail)

## What We Will Cover

Teach through example. I am going to demonstrate the different git commands through a couple of practical scenarios. The goal here is to not only show you the command in action, but also provide the context of why and when you want to use the different commands.

The training vehicle I have set up for this is the training material itself.
