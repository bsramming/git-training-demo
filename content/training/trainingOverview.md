# What to Expect From This Training

This training is going to be a little different. Gone are the PowerPoints!

The best way to learn git is seeing how it is used first-hand in a practical example!

## You will learn:
- How to use the primary git commands
- How git integrates into your flow for the better
- A better understanding of how git can benefit your projects

All the training material and content can be found on a git repo! (Are you surprised?)
