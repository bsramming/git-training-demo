# What We Wont Cover

Git is a big topic! Sadly we don't have time to go through everything. We hope this training sparks your curiosity about Git and if you have ideas for future training in a specific area lets chat!

Here are a few things we won't cover:

- Git installation
- Account & System setup for a git provider (i.e. GitHub)
- Repository creation. Typically handled through the git provider easily.
- Branching models. Will mention a very basic idea but this is more team-specific discussion.
- Integration tools. Git IDE integration, GitHub Desktop, etc. There's LOTS of tools/plugins built on top of Git.
- Pull requests, merging, and reviews.
