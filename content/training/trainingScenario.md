# Training Scenario

## User Story #1 - Add a Table of Contents
The user's love the git training content! However, there is no easy way to get to all the content. It's all contained in separate pages and they have to be opened individually. It would be nice to have a table-of-contents page for the material.

## User Story #2 - Update the References
It would be nice to provide user's with a simple reference page for additional resources on Git. Can provide links to where to download git, and maybe references on more advanced topics such as branching model.
